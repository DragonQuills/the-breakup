# The Breakup
A short game created in Ren'Py for Ace Jam, 2022.

You and Casper have known each other since middle school. You know him better than you know yourself, but he's been growing more distant and more unhappy these past few months and doesn't seem to have realized it. So when he calls you in the middle of the night to tell you he needs your help, you know you'll do everything you can to help him make it through the roughest night he's been through in a long, long time.
